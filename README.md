# Calculator

> React assignment

## Question Description
Create a basic calculator using react. Your app should have below mentioned functionality.
* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide

## Tasks:
1) Present all digits(0 to 9) and five symbols (*, %, +, -, =) and a display area (No need to write fancy css).

2) Allow all four operations to happen. User should be able to use last result with a variable "_". For simplicity you can clear the screen once user presses a symbol.

3) Allow user to use both keyboard or onscreen fields.

Eg:
  * User presses 1123 (Display area shows 1123)
  * User presses * (Display area now only shows *)
  * User presses 0 (Display area now only shows 0)
  * User presses enter or = symbol (Display area now shows 0)
  * This complete one cycle.
  * In the next cycle user selects _ + 3 (Display area should now show 3)
  * In the next cycle user selects _ * 4 (Display area should now show 12)

* Note: User need not focus on the display for the calculator to work. Eveything should work even without touching the mouse.
